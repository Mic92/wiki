# zimbatm's cafe

Some background chill electro, the sound of people hacking on their own
projects. This is zimbatm's virtual cafe. No beverages included.

Working remotely can be lonely. This is about just sharing presence and
motivation.

## Etiquette

* **No talking!** - people are focused on their work. But feel free to wave
  and smile when joining :-)
* Keep your camera on. The point is to see other people working and make this
  symmetrical.
* Mute yourself if you have a noisy background environment.
* Break out into other rooms for 1:1 discussions.
* Enjoy!

## Setup

TODO: it would be nice to have some background music or a DJ. Maybe tied to a
Spotify or YouTube Music account?
