# zimbatm's cafe

Some background chill electro, the sound of people hacking on their own
projects. This is zimbatm's virtual cafe. No beverages included.

Working remotely can be lonely. This is about just sharing presence and
motivation.

## Etiquette

* **No talking!** - people are focused on their work.
* Feel free to wave, smile or communicate in the chat.
* Break out into other rooms for 1:1 discussions.
* Enjoy!
